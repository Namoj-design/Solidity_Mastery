## 🚀 Getting Started
You can start learning Solidity in just a few steps:
1. **Remix IDE**:  
   - Visit [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) (no installation required).
   - Upload any `.sol` file from this repo and start experimenting!
2. **Local Environment**:  
   - Install the Solidity compiler:  
     ```bash
     npm install -g solc
     ```
   - Or, use frameworks like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/).
3. **Clone this Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Solidity_Mastery.git
   ```
